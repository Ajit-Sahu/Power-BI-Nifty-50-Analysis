I've developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that provides an in-depth analysis of the top Nifty 50 stocks from January 1, 2020, to May 31, 2024. This tool delivers detailed insights across various time frames such as days, months, quarters, and more. It also facilitates the analysis of trends among the top 50 Nifty companies over the past four years.

Here's what you can explore on the dashboard:

1. Sector and Company Returns: Detailed breakdowns of returns by sector and individual companies.
2. Trend Analysis: Insights into market trends over the last four years, highlighting periods of high returns for specific stocks.
3. Investment Planning: Actionable data to help plan and optimize future investments based on historical performance.
